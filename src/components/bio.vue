			<p>Hey! I'm <u>Neil</u>, a 19-year-old Computer Science student from the Philippines.</p>
			<p>I am a <span style='color: #d81357'>passionate</span> developer specializing in back-end technologies with a strong focus on the Spring Framework. My expertise also extends to the front-end with <span style='color:green;'>VueJs</span>. </p>
			<p>As far as my <span style='border-bottom: 2px solid #f9c549'>knowledge</span> goes, I know <u>nothing</u> just like what <span style='color: #506ee7; font-weight:bold;'>Socrates</span> said. I'm still honing my skills on both back-end and front-end technologies :></p>
			<p>I like writing <b>clean</b>, <b>maintainable</b> and <b>efficient</b> code without sacrificing <b>performance</b> and by always prioritizing <b>user-experience</b> in every project. </p>
			<p>When I'm not coding or working on any projects, I like to spend my time with <span style='color:#ff2d54'>meine frau</span>, training and working out, reading books, studying, and playing games. I am weird, I was born with an immense <b>curiosity</b> and a hunger for knowledge. God nerfed me with memory loss though.</p>
